Assignment 2 – Object-Oriented Programming
Description:
This project demonstrates the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming using a cultural domain.
The system models artworks, artists and galleries as objects.

Implemented concepts:
- Data abstraction using an abstract base class CulturalObject
- Encapsulation through private fields and public methods
- Inheritance by extending the base class
- Polymorphism via overridden getScore() methods
- Data pool management using ArrayList
- Searching, filtering and sorting of objects
- Overriding toString(), equals() and hashCode() methods
